# My Very First Website

Welcome!

My very first website was a very interesting build. 
I learned **lots** of things that i never knew before. 

## What I learned

Firt of all I learned all about HTML files. Learned about titles, headings, divs, spans and much much more. 
After learning about html, i moved on to learn about CSS (cascading style sheets). I found this quite difficult 
but i also really enjoyed it. 

Then I went on to learn all about git and github. I also found this *very* difficlut but i got through it. I think
it will need alot of practice. 

Im looking forward to getting more familiar with git and github as the time goes on.
